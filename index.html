      <p>
        Hello! My name is Colin Bragger, and I'm a 4th year student at the University of Maryland. 
        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm an in-state student from Montgomery County, MD. I've lived in Maryland my whole life. I've been programming
        for almost 8 years at this point, which doesn't make me an expert due to the diverse languages/systems I've
        experienced, but has done well preparing me for the future. My biggest preparation for the future, however, 
        is my membership of Air Force ROTC, where I'm currently about to be locked in to commission as a Cyber 
        Operations Officer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether it's building them, gaming on them, programming, or tinkering, my main interest has always been computers.
        Beyond that, I am also an Eagle Scout, so I love camping, hiking, biking, and all sorts of boating. Just being out
        in nature is one of my biggest interests.
      </p>
